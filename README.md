# Sales-Performance-Dashboard
## Introduction
The Sales Performance Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key performance indicators (KPIs) related to business sales. It enables stakeholders to track customer activity, sales trends, and revenue generation, offering insights into the overall business performance. The dashboard visually represents data through various metrics such as total customers, total quantity sold, total sales, and total income. Additionally, it categorizes sales based on product lines, payment methods, gender, and branches to provide deeper analytical insights.

- Time Series Line Chart
- Bar Charts
- Pie Chart
## Data Analysis
## KPI Cards (Total Customers, Total Quantity Sold, Total Sales, Total Income)
![KPIs](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6aaade24-c523-4745-af67-820a4d838ee4)
These four KPI cards provide an overview of key business metrics. Number of unique customers, total number of items sold, total revenue generated, and total income. 
## Sales Trend Over Time (Line Chart)
This chart shows how sales fluctuate over time, helping to identify trends, seasonality, or sudden spikes and drops in sales performance.

## Data Analysis
From the dashboard, key insights include:
- Sales fluctuations over time indicate seasonal trends.
- Top-performing product lines include food & beverages and sports & travel.
- Preferred payment methods include cash, credit card, and e-wallets.
- Gender-based sales show a near-equal split between male and female customers.
- Branch comparison reveals performance differences across locations.
## Recommendations
- Boost High-Performing Product Lines – Since Food & Beverages and Sports & Travel generate the most revenue, focus on expanding these categories with promotions, bundles, or new product variations while improving weaker categories.
- Improve Payment Flexibility – Customers are using cash, credit cards, and e-wallets almost equally. Encouraging digital payments with cashback offers or discounts can enhance convenience and drive more transactions.
- Enhance Underperforming Branches – If a branch is lagging in sales, analyze factors like location, customer preferences, or staff performance. Running localized promotions or adjusting inventory may help boost performance.
- Leverage Customer Insights – With sales split nearly 50-50 between male and female customers, targeted marketing strategies (like gender-specific promotions or loyalty rewards) can further enhance engagement.
- Use Predictive Analytics for Sales Forecasting – Implementing AI-driven insights to predict future sales trends can help in inventory planning and demand forecasting, reducing stockouts and excess inventory.
By taking these actions, businesses can increase revenue, improve customer experience, and stay ahead of the competition!
